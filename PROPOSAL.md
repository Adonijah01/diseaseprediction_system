## 1. BACKGROUND
The Nairobi Hospital is known to be a leading healthcare facility not only in Kenya but also in East Africa, having advanced diagnostics, treatments and specialized services. It is a non-profit organization with a history dating back to 1954, evolving from a European Hospital to a modern, high-technology facility. However, being a busy hospital, it often faces the challenge of diagnosing many patients quickly and accurately. Due to the increasing number of patients and the complexity of diseases, doctors may be overwhelmed, encounter delays or make errors especially when different illnesses share similar symptoms.
This proposal presents a solution using Data Science, a disease prediction system that uses machine learning to analyze symptoms and predict possible diseases. The system will support healthcare workers by suggesting the most likely conditions based on past patient data, therefore saving time and fostering better decision-making.

## 2. PROBLEM STATEMENT
One of the major challenges is that many diseases share similar symptoms, making diagnosis difficult especially in high-pressure environments like hospitals. This results to doctors and nurses being overwhelmed often, which can lead to misdiagnosis, delayed treatment and increased risks for patients. Therefore, there is need for a smart, supportive tool that can assist medical staff in predicting diseases quickly and accurately based on patient symptoms.

## 3. OBJECTIVES
**Main Objective:**
- To develop a machine learning-based system that predicts diseases from analyzing patient symptoms to assist doctors in diagnosis at Nairobi Hospital

**Specific objectives:**
- To collect and prepare patient data from the hospital
- To explore and identify patterns and trends between symptoms and diseases
- To train and test machine learning models for accurate disease prediction
- To build a simple and interactive interface for entering symptoms and receiving predictions
- To evaluate the accuracy and usefulness of the system in a real-world hospital setting

## 4. LITERATURE REVIEW
Several studies have explored the use of artificial intelligence in healthcare. For example, research has shown that machine learning algorithms can detect diseases like diabetes, heart conditions, and pneumonia with high accuracy. Systems like IBM Watson and Google's DeepMind have been tested in clinical environments for diagnosis support.
In Kenya, the use of AI in hospitals is still growing, and there is a gap when it comes to disease prediction tools based on local data. This project builds on global research but focuses specifically on a Kenyan hospital environment, using real patient data and locally relevant diseases.

## 5. METHODOLOGY
The project will follow a step-by-step process:
- Data Collection: Get anonymized patient records from Nairobi Hospital, containing symptoms and confirmed diseases.
- Data Preprocessing: Clean the data to handle missing values, remove errors, and prepare it for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand which symptoms are most common and how they relate to specific diseases.
- Model Training: Use machine learning algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest) to create a model that can learn from the data.
- Model Evaluation: Test how well the model performs using evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
- System Interface: Develop a simple front-end where users can input symptoms and view predictions.

## 6. DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGY
I will use an agile development approach, where I divide the project into smaller phases. This allows for continuous improvement at every stage:
- Phase 1: Data gathering and cleaning
- Phase 2: Model development and testing
- Phase 3: Building the user interface
- Phase 4: Final integration, testing, and documentation
Each phase will be reviewed before moving to the next to ensure quality, accuracy and functionality.
